This assignment is done in a group. Group members:

	1. Josyula Venkata Aditya - 210050075
	2. Kartik Sreekumar Nair - 210050083

The submission folder contains four folders(in addition to this file and the problem statement file, out of
which data is an empty folder):

	1. code - contains 5 MATLAB LiveScript(.mlx) files, each of which corresponds to one of the 5 problems.

	2. results/fig - contains 5 folders; each folder corresponds to a problem and contains the plots of that
	problem. This is the main folder of plots, please perform the evaluations of plots using this folder. The
	plots/eps folder contains .eps files which are used in the report, since it is easier to attach .eps files
	than .fig files

	3. results/eps - contains all the plots, but in .eps format. For evaluation purposes, please check the
	plots in plots/fig folder and NOT this folder.

	4. report - contains the reports of the 5 problems


*Note: We have seeded the random number generator in the first section in every .mlx file. So, please select
the first section and ”Run to End” to replicate the results.
